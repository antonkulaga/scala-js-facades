THREE.js subproject contains facade of threejs plus some extra classes.
In Extras there are extra facades for some javascript classes that are often used together with THREE.js
In Extensions there are extra ScalaJS classes like:
    * Container3D class that allows to easily setup a scene with both webgl and css renderers
    * HoverControls, that adds hovering around the chosen vertex, similar to orbitcontrol but does not block sprite events
    * Intersection controls that are useful for dealing with intersections and mouse moves on top
